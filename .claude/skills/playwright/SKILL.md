# Playwright for moreh-derech-next

This project is a large static web app with many browser test scripts.

Playwright and Chromium are already installed in Claude Code cloud sessions: `require('playwright')`
works from any directory and `chromium.launch()` needs no options.
**Never run `npx playwright install`** or add another Playwright version — it won't find the browser.
Anything else that needs a Chrome binary uses `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` with `--headless --no-sandbox`.
(On a local machine without that path, use the project's own Playwright install.)

## 1. Serve the app

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev   # node tests/dev-server.mjs on http://localhost:8787
```

Wait until the URL answers (`curl -sf <url>`) before driving it.

## 2. This project

- Many browser suites already exist: `npm run e2e:<name>` (v3, v4, solo, map, journey, jerusalem3d, sites3d, exam, sadna, modes, repertoire, history, architecture, world3d, tours, hadracha, parta, campus) and `npm run screens`. Run the one(s) matching the area you changed.
- Unit tests: `npm test` (node --test).
- 3D scenes (Jerusalem 3D, sites 3D, world 3D) use WebGL: give them time to render before screenshots and check for WebGL errors in the console.

## 3. Ad-hoc checks (write scripts in the scratchpad, not the repo)

```js
const { chromium, devices } = require('playwright');
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const ctx = await browser.newContext({ ...devices['iPhone 13'] }); // or { viewport: { width: 1280, height: 800 } }
const page = await ctx.newPage();
const errors = [];
page.on('pageerror', (e) => errors.push(e.message));
page.on('console', (m) => m.type() === 'error' && errors.push(m.text()));
await page.goto(URL, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
await page.screenshot({ path: 'shot.png', fullPage: true });
await browser.close();
```

For every visual change, check:
- **Phone and desktop** — `devices['iPhone 13']` and a 1280×800 viewport.
- **No horizontal overflow** — `document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= clientWidth`.
- **No console or page errors** (ignore `net::` noise from hosts the sandbox blocks).
- **Dark mode** if the app supports it — `page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' })`.
- **External services** (databases, APIs): stub them with `page.route` rather than hitting production.

## 4. Screenshots

- For the user: `deviceScaleFactor: 2` (named devices already set their own).
- For your own check: `deviceScaleFactor: 1`.
- Save them outside the repo and send them with SendUserFile; don't commit screenshots.

## 5. Playwright MCP (optional)

If the `mcp__playwright__*` tools are loaded (configured in `.mcp.json`), use them to explore
interactively: `browser_navigate` → `browser_snapshot` (accessibility tree, preferred over
screenshots for finding elements) → `browser_click` / `browser_type` → `browser_take_screenshot`.

## 6. Clean up

Stop any server you started when you're done.
